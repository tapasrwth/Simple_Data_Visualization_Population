# Simple_Data_Visualization_Population
This project consists of simple data visualization and machine learning methods applied on a small set of data consists of 143 countries and their population between 1952-2007

Data Content: "country_population.csv"
Name of 143 Countries and their population for 1952 to 2007

*Used library*: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

#Visualization
1. Line plot: Population vs year for each country
2. Bar plot: Population increase from previous year for any country
4. Line and Barplot: Comparison between 2 countries: population and population increase from previous year
5. Linear Regression to predict population for a given year: scatter plot, regression line, predicted value
6. Barplot: Countries(Top 10) with highest population in 2007 in Descending order
7. Lineplot: Growth Rate compared to population of 1952: comparision between two countries
8. Lineplot: Percentage change between the current and prior year population 
9. Lineplot: Population growth rate(percent growth rate= (population_present - population_past)/time * 100)
10. Barplot: Countries (top 10) with highest population growth
