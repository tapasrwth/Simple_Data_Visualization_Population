#Visualization
1. Line plot: Population vs year for each country
2. Bar plot: Population increase from previous year for any country
4. Line and Barplot: Comparison between 2 countries: population and population increase from previous year
5. Linear Regression to predict population for a given year: scatter plot, regression line, predicted value
6. Barplot: Top 10 countries with highest population in 2007 in Descending order
7. Growth Rate compared to population of 1952: comparision between two countries
8. 
9. Population growth rate(percent growth rate= (population_present - population_past)/time * 100)
